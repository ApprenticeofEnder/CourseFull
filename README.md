# CourseFull
> How students know where they're at from the *first* minute, not the *last*.

There's a long-running meme of calculating what you need to get on a final exam to pass a course. 

But if you're doing that to know what you need at the last minute, why not do it from minute one? For *all* of your deliverables, across *all* of your courses, and update it throughout the semester?

Making a spreadsheet for that is a lot of work. **That's what CourseFull is for.**
